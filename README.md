# Car_Parking_Counter_OpenCV

This repository contains a Python project for counting available car parking spaces using the OpenCV library. 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a system that can analyze camera feeds from parking lots or garages and accurately count the number of available parking spaces in real-time.

Features :-
Real-time car parking space counting.
Utilizes computer vision techniques from OpenCV for accurate space detection.
Supports various camera angles and lighting conditions.
Easy-to-customize parameters for different parking lot setups.
Provides visual output with annotated parking spaces.
